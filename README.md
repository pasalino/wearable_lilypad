# Wearable Arduino Shirt

## Abstract
There is an example of Wearable T-Shit with temperature sensor

## Mission
This project is created for [IoT meetup Milano](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/IoT-Meetup-Milano/)

[A che temperatura sono le tue ascelle?](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/preview/IoT-Meetup-Milano/events/243097793)

It's a basic example to use Arduino Lilypad


## Electrical Scheme
In docs there is an Electrical scheme for build a device
Use Fritzing for open and look how connect all components


### Components
* Arduino lilypad
* Temperature sensor MCP9700A
* Inox Wire for wear
* 1 Blue blank led
* Coin Battery holder 
* Coin battery CR2032 3v
